### **Time Complexity Analysis:**

1. **Graph Construction (Adjacency List):**
   - Iterating through all edges and populating the adjacency list takes **O(E)** time, where E is the number of edges.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - Each node is visited exactly once during DFS, and for each node, all its adjacent edges are processed. This results in **O(V + E)** time for DFS, where V is the number of nodes (vertices).

3. **Processing Components:**
   - After DFS, we collect the sizes of connected components in `v1`. This takes **O(V)** time (since we process each node once).

4. **Calculating Pairs:**
   - For each connected component of size `i`, we compute `i * (sum - i)` and decrement `sum` by `i`. This loop runs in **O(K)** time, where K is the number of connected components (which is at most V).

**Total Time Complexity:**
- The dominant term is the DFS traversal, which is **O(V + E)**. The other steps are linear or involve simple arithmetic.
- **Final Time Complexity: O(V + E)**.

### **Space Complexity Analysis:**

1. **Adjacency List (`v`):**
   - Stores all nodes and their edges. In the worst case (a complete graph), this takes **O(V + E)** space.

2. **Visited Array (`vis`):**
   - A boolean array of size **O(V)** to track visited nodes.

3. **Component Sizes (`v1`):**
   - Stores the sizes of connected components. In the worst case (all nodes disconnected), this takes **O(V)** space.

4. **Recursive DFS Stack:**
   - In the worst case (a straight-line graph), the recursion depth can be **O(V)**.

**Total Space Complexity:**
- The adjacency list dominates, so **O(V + E)**.

### **Final Answer:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(V + E)  

Where:
- V = number of nodes (vertices).
- E = number of edges.
